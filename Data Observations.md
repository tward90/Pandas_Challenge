* You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Observation #1

Surprisingly, the scores achieved by the students seem to have less to do with The amount of money spent or the size of the school (see observation #3), and more seem to depend on the type of school the student attends with the Charter School students achieving the best grades with the least amount of funding. Without further budgetary data, I can't begin to suggest why that is, but on a macro-economic level, the more successful schools appear to be the charter schools.

Observation #2

While the charter schools performed at a higher level when compared to their district counterparts, the more commanding lead was specifically in the math scores. This seems to indicate that there is a focus on what I would assume to be math and science skills at the charter schools in the disctrict. They are still outperformint he district schools in reading as well, but the standouts were most definitely the math scores.

Observation #3

It is difficult to tell if the size of the school has significant impact on the results or if it is more dependant on the type of school. It's tricky because charter schools are smaller than the district schools, and also have less funding. So I would go so far as to say the type of school the student attends has more of an impact than the size of the institution or the amount of money it receives.
